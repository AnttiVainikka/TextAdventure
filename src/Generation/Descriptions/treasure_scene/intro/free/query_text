The player is on an adventure in {{region_name}}.
{{region_description}}

Within {{region_name}} the player is currently in {{area_name}}. The description of {{area_name}} is the following:
{{area_description}}

Within this region there is a treasure chest.
Extend or rewrite the description in such a way, that it fits around the treasure chest.
Try to include some hint that this might be a trap.
This will be printed to the player so instead of using "the player" use "you".
