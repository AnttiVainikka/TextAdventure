# I think each scene should have a reward for the player. Currently the ways the player
# can become stronger are getting exp, finding/looting a new piece of equipment,
# learning some new skill, receiving bonuses to stats (hp,atk,magic) or having
# their hp and/or skill uses restored. New ways can be created but for the time being
# I think we could let the LLM choose one of these rewards for the player as well as
# some challenge for the player to overcome and let that be the foundation for each scene.
