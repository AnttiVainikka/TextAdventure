With no heir to the throne and the noble families in disarray, the power vacuum created an opportunity for Cassia Mosswood to make her move. Cassia Mosswood seized the opportunity presented by the chaos and uncertainty to manipulate and coerce the noble families into supporting her bid for the throne. Through cunning political maneuvering and leveraging her extensive wealth, she secured the loyalty of key figures and orchestrated a campaign to ascend to power.\n\nDriven by her insatiable hunger for influence and control, Cassia Mosswood saw the crisis as a chance to fulfill her thirst for power.
